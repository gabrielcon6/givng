# GIVNG APP

-- Deployed demo version [Heroku]: https://givng.herokuapp.com/

- This app was created as a group project for the third assignment of our Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly Sydney/Australia.
  The code was written by Chen He, Gabriel Conceicao, and Paulo Amaral.

- The app is made to create lists of presents and split a given budget among people within those lists.

- First, you create a new givng, let's say a 'Christmas List', inside this GIVNG you can have different categories (eg. family, colleagues, friends, etc).

- Second, you set a budget for each category, let's use \$100 for your family as an example. Inside your family list, you have added 4 people (Mom, Dad, Brother and Sister).

- Third, the App will let will mark present as bought for each one of them, and furthermore give you suggestions of presents around \$25 (split budget) to your loved ones :)
