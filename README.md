# GIVGN APP
-- Deployed demo version [Heroku]: https://givng.herokuapp.com/

- This app was created as a group project for our third assignment of our Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly Sydney/Australia.
The code was written by Chen He, Gabriel Conceicao, and Paulo Amaral.

- The app is made to create lists of presents and split a given budget among people within those lists.

- First you create a new givng, lets say a 'Christmas List', inside this GIVNG you can have different categories (eg. family, coleagues, frieds, etc).

- Second you set an budget for each categorie, lets use $100 for your family as an example. Inside your family list you have added 4 people (Mum, Dad, Bro, and Sis).

- Third the App will let will mark present as bought for each one of them, and furthermore give you suggestions of presents around $25 (split budget) to your loved ones :)
